# Formulator Files
The current purpose is to search multiple sites for a specified ingredient. 

This is primarily to become a tool or set of tools for me, as a formulator. As I build it out, if it looks like something that may be useful to other formulators, I may iterate towards that.

## Setup 
Right now, only the shell version is set up for ingredient search. For that reason, I've only included info for this file. 

1. Download/copy ingredient-search.sh
2. In the terminal, navigate to that file
3. Add executable permissions `chmod +x ingredient-search.sh` and press **Enter**/**Return**

## Use
From the directory this file is located, type `./ingredient-search.sh` and press **Enter**/**Return**

## Issues
* Only ingredient-search.sh is set up
* The web version is not set up yet (it just opens lotioncrafter.com with 'jojoba' search results)
